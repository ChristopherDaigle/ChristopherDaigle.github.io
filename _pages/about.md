Hi, I'm Christopher Daigle.

I work as a data scientist for Pratt & Whitney, a jet engine manufacturer owned by Raytheon Technologies, in Aftermarket Supply Chain for Commercial Engines. A lot of my work is focused on software development with Python, but I am evolving my group to employ more advanced approaches with analytics and machine learning.

My academic credential highlights are:
* MS in Quantitative Economics from University of Connecticut
* First 2-years course work of an economics PhD
* Economic research in partnership with Yale University, University of Connecticut, George Mason University, Boise State University, and Idaho Voices for Children

All of my work is around a quantitative and computational methods applied to real-world problems.

On a more personal note, I am a father, husband, and a guy who loves to smoke brisket.

Here is my resume:
