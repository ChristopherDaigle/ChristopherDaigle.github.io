Hi, I'm Christopher Daigle.

I work as a data scientist for [Pratt & Whitney](https://prattwhitney.com/en), a jet engine manufacturer owned by [Raytheon Technologies](https://www.rtx.com).

Machine learning is my speciality, but most of my work is focused on software development with [Python](https://www.python.org). I am evolving my group to employ more advanced approaches with analytics and machine learning.

On the personal side: I am a father, husband, and a guy who loves to smoke brisket.

My academic credential highlights are:
* [MS in Quantitative Economics](https://msqe.econ.uconn.edu) from [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu)
* Economic research in partnership with [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu), [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu), [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu), [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu), and [Idaho Voices for Children](https://www.idahovoices.org)
* First 2-years course work of an economics PhD at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu)
